1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. When you want to show your work or need some changes to your work from others and make edits to it.
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. Manually pull changes only when you want the changes to happen in the local and can have a seperate path. Automatic pull wil introduce all changes automatically with allowing to make any changes and having more commit in the file.
